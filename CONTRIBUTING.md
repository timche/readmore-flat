### gulp.js Tasks

#### `gulp`

`gulp` is our main task and will be used during the development. It compiles all files from `src/` into a `dist/` folder and watches our files on changes and re-compiles them automatically.

### `gulp build`

`gulp build` generates a production-ready build. All files are going to be minified and a .zip file will be created of the `dist/` folder that can be used to be submitted in the Chrome Web Store.

2. Activate `Developer mode`.
